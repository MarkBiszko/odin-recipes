    <h2><em><strong>Description</strong></em></h2>
<p>Yangnyeom chicken is double deep fried chicken that is coated with sticky, spicy and sweet sauce. In my opinion, the taste and the sensation is almost magical! It’s super delicious and addictive!</p>
<p>Also, Korean fried chicken is often associated with beer. I don’t know the reasons, but they sure go well together! (Though my preference is pairing it with this ginger beer since I don’t drink alcoholic beverages often.)</p>
<h2><em><strong>Ingredients</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
    <li>1/2 yellow onion, grated</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon freshily ground black pepper</li>
    <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    <li>3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1/3 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
</ul>
<h2><em><strong>Steps</strong></em></h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.
    </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).
    </li>
    <li>While oil is heating, make batter: Whisk together cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles smooth pancake batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.</li>
    <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
    <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
    <li>Enjoy with friends and family</li>
</ol>
